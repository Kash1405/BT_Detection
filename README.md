# Brain Tumor Detection
What are Brain Tumors?<br>

A brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells in your brain in an uncontrollable way. Many different types of brain tumors exist. Some brain tumors are non-cancerous (benign), and some brain tumors are cancerous (malignant). <br>

Objectives of the project:<br>

The following project entails a brain tumor detection model built to identify MRI scans positive for brain tumors from the input MRI scans.<br>
